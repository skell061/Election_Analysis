# Election Analysis

## Election Audit Overview
For the Colorado Board of Elections we performed a few tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Usin Python we calculated the toe total number of votes cast, extracted a complete list of candidates who received votes, calculated the total number of votes each candidate received, calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won, determined the winner of the election based on popular vote, got the voter turnout for each county, calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and finally determined the county with the highest voter turnout.
